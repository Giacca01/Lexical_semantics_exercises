# Lexical semantics using Machine Learning

This repository contains two exercises on lexical semantic using machine learning, developed during the
Natural Language Processing course, held at the University of Turin in the academic year 2024/2025.

# Description
The first exercise leverages contextual word embedding learn by the BERT model to solve the
Word In Context task, using logistic regression, with near state of the art performance.

The second exercise explores the ability of static word embeddings learn by Word2Vec to capture
semantic properties.
This is done by analyzing the semantic neighbourhoods of some words and applying cluster algorithms.
